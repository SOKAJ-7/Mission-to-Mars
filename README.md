# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to scrape data of interest from NASA's news website regarding the planet of Mars. This was accomplished using python libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Splinter, and WebDriver as well as Flask and MongoDB. These libraries were designed to extract targeted information from this website by using the python libraries to interact with the html code of the website. This information was stored in python and through writing out own html code, was able to be displayed on a new webpage created in this project. This project was not able to be completed however and stalled in the stages of trying to apply new changes to the html code for the web-scraping webpage.
